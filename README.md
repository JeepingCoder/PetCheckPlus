Enter the .env file. It should show the following information plus your personal password (remember to add this to the .gitignore) DB_NAME='petcheck_db' DB_USER='root' DB_PASSWORD =" ". 

 Run an npm install to load json and schema. Next mysql -u root -p submit your password (it will be hidden). Next run source db/schema.sql then you can quit sql. Run npm start you will then see listening in your terminal.

## Roadmap

In the future we would like to see this application further developed to be able to link your pets information to their veterinarian, have a feature to track a lost pet that has been chipped, help find service providers like groomers, pet boarding, veterinarian  and ultimately be a one stop application for all pet owners to have a much easier way to handle anything related to their pet.

Multer setup was gotten from https://www.bezkoder.com/node-js-upload-image-mysql/

Our inspiration was simply being pet owners and the need for a quick organized way of finding our pet or multiple pets information for quick refrence. 

This project was made possible by our instructor Andrew Bautista and teaching staff.
